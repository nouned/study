Study App
This is a simple study app written in python.
It was created as the first assignment for the General Assembly course on Python Programming.
It was awarded full marks for exceeding the requirements of the assignment.
I've shared it here for the benefit of future students who might like a reference or exemplar to consider when making their own submissions.
I can't promise you will be marked as generously as I was.
