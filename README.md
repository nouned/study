# study
<h2>Study App</h2>
<p>This is a simple study app written in python.</p>
<p>It was created as the first assignment for the General Assembly course on Python Programming.</p>
<p>It was awarded full marks for exceeding the requirements of the assignment.</p>
<p>I've shared it here for the benefit of future students who might like a reference or exemplar to consider when making their own submissions.</p>
<p>No promise you will be marked as generously as I was...</p>
